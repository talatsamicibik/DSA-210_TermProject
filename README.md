# Analyzing the Relationship Between Stress and Social Media Usage

## Introduction
This project explores the relationship between the time I spend on social media and the intensity of my working life stress. For this manner I will use my Instagram and YouTube usage data, my assignment deadlines and exam dates. My goal is to find out whether I tend to distract or lack productivity under pressure and stress.

## Motivation
I spend a considerable amount of time on social media, which affects my productivity and social life on daily basis. I want to decrease my average usage per day but also I want to learn more about reasons behind this behaviour. I sense that the more responsibilities arose in time, the more I run away and from them and I find myself on the phone. I would like to find out whether if this is true or there is another reason behind it. That is why decided to work on this project. Based on my findings, I will try to adapt myself to a life with less screen time.

## Hyphothesis
I tend to use social media more when I am under the inluence of academic stress.

## Data Sources and How to Collect Them
- **Instagram Activity Log and YouTube History**: These are the social media platforms that I use most frequently and both of this platforms provide user history and activity datas. I am planning to use the time period between the start of summer break until last week. 
- **Deadlines and Exam Dates**: The most trackable data causing stress. I will manually collect them by looking at my academic calendar, e-mails from instructors and TA's, announcements on SuCourse.

## Challenges
There are definitly other factors increasing social media usage like spare time, chatting, researching, etc. And also there are various factors causing stress and YouTube and Instagram are not the only platforms that I use. This will lead some errors in data but the data will be interpreted accordingly.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Data collection from Instagram YouTube and academic calendar.
- **Week 2**: Research about course topics, i.e Phyton usage, EDA techniques and Phyton libraries to plot them, etc. 
- **Week 3**: Analysis and hypothesis testing.
- **Week 4**: Interpretation and final report.
